The only mod that simulates organic chemistry and relativity, Cyens Toy is a mod by firefreak11 that aims to revive The Science Toy and the Unrealistic Science Mod series in order to create an up-to-date version that will do more than ever before. 

Cyens Toy is a the modern successor to firefreak11's Mod, The Unrealistic Science Mod, and The Science Toy, containing major features that are focused on particular branches of modern science. Cyens Toy is released in a continuous integration (CI) schedule, where new features are available to download as soon as they are implemented on firefreak11's PC. 

Cyens Toy could use more developers! Join the Discord channel to talk about contributing to the mod.
